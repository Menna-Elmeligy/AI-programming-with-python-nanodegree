## AI-programming-with-python-nanodegree
This repository has my submissions for Udacity's nanodegree program in AI Programming with Python.

Please take note that Udacity provides the basic code for the projects as a starting point.


Dog breed identification using a pre-trained image classifier
The first study included utilizing a predetermined picture classifier to distinguish between different dog breeds. The focus was on showing off the essential Python skills for setting up a machine learning project, such as dealing with the data, looking at various metrics, and examining the outcomes and run times of various classifiers, rather than on training or developing the classifier.
